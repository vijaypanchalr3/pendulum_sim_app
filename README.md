# pendulum_sim_app
python app for simulation of penudulums



this app demonstrate my project of consequences of approximation in physics, also one to demonstrate physics solution behaviour.

further possible work to make library which gives better physics simulation. there'll be some possible solution types, library should addres those and work with them to ensure we can visualize it's behaviour.
